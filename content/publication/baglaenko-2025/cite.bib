 abstract = {Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual
disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal
alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing
has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease
alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous
editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes
caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the
functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges,
we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly
identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures
cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the
effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding
single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify
the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the
state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T
cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA
sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human
cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases.
A plate-based assay called CRAFTseq has been developed that uses ‘multi-omic’
single-cell RNA sequencing and direct genotyping of CRISPR edits to test the
functional effects of genetic variants on cell state and function.},
