abstract: Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual disease-associated
  non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal alleles and their functions
  remains a critical bottleneck. CRISPR–Cas editing has enabled targeted modification
  of DNA to introduce and test disease alleles. However, the combination of inefficient
  editing, heterogeneous editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional
  changes caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect
  the functional consequences of disease alleles. To overcome these challenges,
  we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly identifies
  genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures cell-surface protein expression.
  We apply this approach to investigate the effects of gene disruption, deletions
  in regulatory regions, non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed
  editing. We identify the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms,
  including the state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human
  T cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA sequencing,
  enable the identification of causal variation in primary human cells and bridge
  a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases. A plate-based assay
  called CRAFTseq has been developed that uses ‘multi-omic’ single-cell RNA sequencing
  and direct genotyping of CRISPR edits to test the functional effects of genetic
  variants on cell state and function.
