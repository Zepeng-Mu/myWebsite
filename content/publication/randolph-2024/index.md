abstract: Humans exhibit considerable variability in their immune responses to the
  same immune challenges. Such variation is widespread and affects individual and
  population-level susceptibility to infectious diseases and immune disorders. Although
  the factors influencing immune response diversity are partially understood, what
  mechanisms lead to the wide range of immune traits in healthy individuals remain
  largely unexplained. Here, we discuss the role that natural selection has played
  in driving phenotypic differences in immune responses across populations and present-day
  susceptibility to immune-related disorders. Further, we touch on future directions
  in the field of immunogenomics, highlighting the value of expanding this work to
  human populations globally, the utility of modeling the immune response as a dynamic
  process, and the importance of considering the potential polygenic nature of natural
  selection. Identifying loci acted upon by evolution may further pinpoint variants
  critically involved in disease etiology, and designing studies to capture these
  effects will enrich our understanding of the genetic contributions to immunity and
  immune dysregulation.
