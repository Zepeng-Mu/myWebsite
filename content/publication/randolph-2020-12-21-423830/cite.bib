 abstract = {Humans vary in their susceptibility to infectious disease, partly due to variation in the immune response following infection. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to this variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, focusing specifically on the transcriptional response to influenza infection. We find that monocytes are the most responsive to influenza infection, but that all cell types mount a conserved interferon response, which is stronger in individuals with increased European ancestry. By comparing European American and African American individuals, we show that genetic ancestry effects on expression are common, influencing 29% of genes, but highly cell type specific. Further, we demonstrate that much of this population-associated expression variation is explained by cis expression quantitative trait loci, which are enriched for signatures of recent positive selection. Our findings establish common cis-regulatory variants -- including those that are differentiated by genetic ancestry -- as important determinants of the antiviral immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
