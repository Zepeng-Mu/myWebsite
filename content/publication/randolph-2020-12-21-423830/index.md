abstract: Humans vary in their susceptibility to infectious disease, partly due to
  variation in the immune response following infection. Here, we used single-cell
  RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to this variation in peripheral
  blood mononuclear cells, focusing specifically on the transcriptional response to
  influenza infection. We find that monocytes are the most responsive to influenza
  infection, but that all cell types mount a conserved interferon response, which
  is stronger in individuals with increased European ancestry. By comparing European
  American and African American individuals, we show that genetic ancestry effects
  on expression are common, influencing 29% of genes, but highly cell type specific.
  Further, we demonstrate that much of this population-associated expression variation
  is explained by cis expression quantitative trait loci, which are enriched for signatures
  of recent positive selection. Our findings establish common cis-regulatory variants
  -- including those that are differentiated by genetic ancestry -- as important determinants
  of the antiviral immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared
  no competing interest.
