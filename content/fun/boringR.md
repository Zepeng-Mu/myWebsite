R provides us with a graphical tool that is precise, beautiful and easy to learn. Besides academic publishing, R can also be used to do arts. Inspired by some blogs, I also tried to plot something beautiful and interesting by R. I call this "boringR" and you can find all the code on my Github.

Here I would to share with you some of my codes and my creations.

### Colorful Bars
In the first example, I use the `segments` function to draw some colorful bars. The `sample` function is used to generate random heights of bars.

```{r}
myWidth = 10
myheight = 6
number_of_bars = 30

xStart = seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_bars)
yStartPos = rep(0.5, number_of_bars)
yStartNeg = -yStartPos

yEndPos = sample(1:myheight, size = number_of_bars, replace = T)
yEndNeg = -yEndPos

myColPos = rainbow(number_of_bars, alpha = 0.8)
myColNeg = rainbow(number_of_bars, alpha = 0.4)

# Plot
mypar = par(bg = 'black', mar = rep(0.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), ylim = c(-myWidth, myWidth))
segments(xStart, yStartPos, xStart, yEndPos, col = myColPos, lwd = 12)
segments(xStart, yStartNeg, xStart, yEndNeg, col = myColNeg, lwd = 12)

# signature
legend("bottomright", legend="Â© Phoenix", bty = "n", text.col="gray70")
```

The graph generated by codes above look like:
