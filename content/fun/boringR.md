R provides us with a graphical tool that is precise, beautiful and easy to learn. Besides academic publishing, R can also be used to do arts. Inspired by some blogs, I also tried to plot something beautiful and interesting by R. I call this "boringR" and you can find all the code on my Github.

Here I would to share with you some of my codes and my creations.

### Colorful Bars
In the first example, I use the `segments` function to draw some colorful bars. The `sample` function is used to generate random heights of bars.

```{r}
myWidth = 10
myheight = 6
number_of_bars = 30

xStart = seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_bars)
yStartPos = rep(0.5, number_of_bars)
yStartNeg = -yStartPos

yEndPos = sample(1:myheight, size = number_of_bars, replace = T)
yEndNeg = -yEndPos

myColPos = rainbow(number_of_bars, alpha = 0.8)
myColNeg = rainbow(number_of_bars, alpha = 0.4)

# Plot
mypar = par(bg = 'black', mar = rep(0.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), ylim = c(-myWidth, myWidth))
segments(xStart, yStartPos, xStart, yEndPos, col = myColPos, lwd = 12)
segments(xStart, yStartNeg, xStart, yEndNeg, col = myColNeg, lwd = 12)

# signature
legend("bottomright", legend="© Phoenix", bty = "n", text.col="gray70")
```

The graph generated by codes above look like:

### Colurful Beams

```{r}
myWidth = 5
number_of_points = 50

x0 = rep(-2, number_of_points)
y0 = rep(0, number_of_points)

xFixed = sin(seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_points))
yFixed = cos(seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_points))

xRandom = xFixed + rnorm(number_of_points, mean = 0.6, sd = 2)
yRandom = yFixed + rnorm(number_of_points, mean = 0, sd = 2)
myLwd = rnorm(number_of_points, mean = 1.3, sd = 0.3)
myLty = sample(c(1, 2, 3), number_of_points, replace = T)

red = sample(seq(0.4, 1, 0.1), number_of_points, replace = T)
green = sample(seq(0, 0.5, 0.1), number_of_points, replace = T)
blue = sample(seq(0, 1, 0.1), number_of_points, replace = T)

mypar = par(bg = 'black', mar = rep(0.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), ylim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), asp = 1)
segments(x0, y0, xRandom, yRandom,
         lwd = myLwd,
         col = rgb(red, green, blue))

legend("bottomright", legend="© Phoenix", bty = "n", text.col="gray70")
```

### Playing with Maths

It is even more interesting to explore the shapes of various mathematics curves. These curves are usually symmetric and looks elaborate. But in fact, they can be plotted by a simple mathematic fomule.

#### Phyllotaxis

According to Wikipedia, phycllotaxis "is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem" in botany. The following code show how to draw phycllotaxis patterns using ggplot2. The code was modified from a Project called *PHYLLOTAXIS: DRAW FLOWERS USING MATHEMATICS* on **Datacamp**.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

angle <- 31*pi/180
points <- 900

t <- (1:points)*angle
x <- sin(t)
y <- cos(t)

df <- data.frame(t, x, y)

options(repr.plot.width = 4, repr.plot.height = 4)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x*t, y*t))
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.8, color = rainbow(points), shape = 16) +
    theme(title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        legend.position = "none")
```
The resulting figure looks like:

By changing the two parameters `angle` and `points` in the code above, one can get endless number of phyllotaxis patterns.
