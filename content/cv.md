## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE
---
### Genome-wide Association Study of cytotoxicity of cisplatin-related chemotherapy drugs

**Advisor: Dr. M. Eileen Dolan**, Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago. *Oct. 2017 - Mar. 2018*

**Procedure:**

- Built mathematical model that best reveal patients’ differences in their ability to clear away cisplatin
- Will investigate the association between residues and traits including BMI and hearing loss, and patients’ genotype to test any SNP that leads to difference in ability to eliminate cisplatin drugs

**Results:**

- 

### Pathogenesis of risk loci associated with type 2 diabetes

**Advisor: Prof. Changqing Zeng**, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. *Aug. 2017 - Jul. 2018*

**Procedure:**

- Cloned putative enhancer segments into pGL4.23 vector
- Performed site mutagenesis for different SNP alleles on enhancer contructs
- Tested enhancer activities in several cell-lines by Luciferase Reporter Assay
- Performed differential expression analysis with limma in enhancer knocked-out cell line
- Performed 4C-seq data analysis with Basic4Cseq and r3Cseq to find potential target genes of the enhancer

**Results:**

- Found two enhancers that are only active in one orientation
- Proved that different alleles in SNPs do not affect enhancer activities
- Found that insulin signaling pathway is disrupted in KO cell line
