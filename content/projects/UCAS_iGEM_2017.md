## UCAS iGEM 2017
---
The international Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) Competition is the world's most renowned biological competition for undergraduates, high school students and even graduate schools, attracting more than 300 teams world-wide each year. To participate, each team is required to come up with a certain problem, and try to adress that using synthetic biology methods during the summer, and to present it to all the iGEMers and judges in an oral presentation and a poster at the *Giant Jamboree* in Boston.

In 2016, I teamed up with my classmates and friends from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) to participate in the competition. In our project, we used an engineered *E. coli* to degrade antibiotic residues, that is, antibiotics found in natural environment that comes from factories and hospitals.

In the project, we also want to raise the public awareness of the urgent problem of antibiotic residues. For more details on the project, please visit our [official wiki](http://2016.igem.org/Team:UCAS).
