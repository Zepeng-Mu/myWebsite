This is the personal website of Zepeng Mu. My English nickname is Phoenix. I took my undergraduate education at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/), and I majored in Biological Sciences. I am now a Ph.D. student in [Committee of Genetics, Genomcis, and Systems Biology (GGSB)](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). My major interest is to use genomics technologies with proper statistical methods to investigate human genome.
