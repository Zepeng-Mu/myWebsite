This is the personal website of Zepeng Mu. My English nickname is Phoenix. I am now a Ph.D. student in [Committee of Genetics, Genomcis, and Systems Biology (GGSB)](https://ggsb.uchicago.edu/) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). I took my undergraduate education at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/) majoring in Biological Sciences.  My major interest is to use genomics technologies with proper statistical methods to understand how genetics variants affect human complex traits, including autoimmune diseases.
