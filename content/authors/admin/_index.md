I am currently a Postdoc in the lab of Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri at Brigham and Women's Hospital. I obtained my Ph.D. at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) with Dr. Yang I. Li. I received my BS from [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](http://english.ucas.ac.cn/), majoring in Biological Sciences. My main research interests are using genomics technologies with proper statistical methods to understand how genetic variants affect human complex traits, with a focus on autoimmune diseases.
