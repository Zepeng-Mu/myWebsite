This is the personal website of Zepeng Mu (call me Phoenix). I am a fourth year undergraduate student from Chinese Academy of Sciences. And I will become a PhD student in Genetics, Genomcis, and Systems Biology at The University of Chicago in fall, 2018. My major interests are using genomics knowledge and technologies, together with proper statistical methods to investigate genetic architecture that is related to human diseases, particularlly cancer. See my CV please.
