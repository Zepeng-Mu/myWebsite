R provides us with a graphical tool that is precise, beautiful and easy to learn. Besides academic publishing, R can also be used to do arts. Inspired by some blogs, I also tried to creat something beautiful and interesting by R. I call this "boringR" and you can find all the code on my [Github repo](https://github.com/Zepeng-Mu/boringR).

Here I would to share with you some of my codes and my creations.

### Colorful Bars
In the first example, I use the `segments` function to draw some colorful bars. The `sample` function is used to generate random heights of bars.

```{r}
myWidth = 10
myheight = 6
number_of_bars = 30

xStart = seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_bars)
yStartPos = rep(0.5, number_of_bars)
yStartNeg = -yStartPos

yEndPos = sample(1:myheight, size = number_of_bars, replace = T)
yEndNeg = -yEndPos

myColPos = rainbow(number_of_bars, alpha = 0.8)
myColNeg = rainbow(number_of_bars, alpha = 0.4)

# Plot
mypar = par(bg = 'black', mar = rep(0.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), ylim = c(-myWidth, myWidth))
segments(xStart, yStartPos, xStart, yEndPos, col = myColPos, lwd = 12)
segments(xStart, yStartNeg, xStart, yEndNeg, col = myColNeg, lwd = 12)

# signature
legend("bottomright", legend="© Phoenix", bty = "n", text.col="gray70")
```

Here, I used `rainbow` function to generate color for bars, and I used different `alpha` values in the function to get *shadow* like effects of the bars.

The graph generated by codes above look like:

### Colurful Beams

```{r}
myWidth = 5
number_of_points = 50

x0 = rep(-2, number_of_points)
y0 = rep(0, number_of_points)

xFixed = sin(seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_points))
yFixed = cos(seq(-myWidth, myWidth, length.out = number_of_points))

xRandom = xFixed + rnorm(number_of_points, mean = 0.6, sd = 2)
yRandom = yFixed + rnorm(number_of_points, mean = 0, sd = 2)
myLwd = rnorm(number_of_points, mean = 1.3, sd = 0.3)
myLty = sample(c(1, 2, 3), number_of_points, replace = T)

red = sample(seq(0.4, 1, 0.1), number_of_points, replace = T)
green = sample(seq(0, 0.5, 0.1), number_of_points, replace = T)
blue = sample(seq(0, 1, 0.1), number_of_points, replace = T)

mypar = par(bg = 'black', mar = rep(0.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), ylim = c(-myWidth, myWidth), asp = 1)
segments(x0, y0, xRandom, yRandom,
         lwd = myLwd,
         col = rgb(red, green, blue))

legend("bottomright", legend="© Phoenix", bty = "n", text.col="gray70")
```

Here I used `rgb` function to generate colors. Moreover, the values for *red*, *green* and *blue* were sampled from a given range. For instance, *red* can only range from 0.4 to 1. This makes the beams look "reddish".

### Colorful Curves
Curves with surprsing shapes can be created by several variables and trigonometric functions.

For instance:

```r
theta = seq(-pi, pi, length = 80)
a = sin(theta)

x = scale(a ^ 2, center = 0, scale = F)
y = cos(theta) - 0.8*sin(theta)
```

This code chunk is the most important since it determine the overall shape of our curve. By changing how `x` and `y` are calculated from `theta`, we can change the shape of the curve quite dramatically.

```r
number_of_curves = 20
red = sample(seq(0.5, 1, 0.1), number_of_curves, replace = T)
green = sample(seq(0, 0.5, 0.1), number_of_curves, replace = T)
blue = sample(seq(0.5, 1, 0.1), number_of_curves, replace = T)
myCol = rgb(red, green, blue, alpha = 0.5)

shrink = seq(0.1, 1, length.out = number_of_curves)

mypar = par(bg = 'black', mar = rep(0.5, 4))
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = range(c(-x, x)), ylim = range(y))
for (i in 1:number_of_curves) {
  lines(x * shrink[i],y * shrink[i],
        col = myCol[i],
        lwd = 2)
}
for (i in 1:number_of_curves) {
  lines(-x * shrink[i], y * shrink[i],
        col = myCol[i],
        lwd = 2)
}

legend("bottomright", legend="© Phoenix", bty = "n", text.col="gray70")
```

There is one more thing that I want say. One can always add randnomness into the graph to make them look better. The use of random colors is one of them. You can also set random line widths or line types to make the graph different.

Last but not least, to learn more about R, I recommend [r-bloggers.com](https://www.r-bloggers.com).
