Such variation is widespread and affects individual and population-level susceptibility to infectious diseases and immune disorders. Although the factors influencing immune response diversity are partially understood, what mechanisms lead to the wide range of immune traits in healthy individuals remain largely unexplained. Here, we discuss the role that natural selection has played in driving phenotypic differences in immune responses across populations and present-day susceptibility to immune-related disorders. Further, we touch on future directions in the field of immunogenomics, highlighting the value of expanding this work to human populations globally, the utility of modeling the immune response as a dynamic process, and the importance of considering the potential polygenic nature of natural selection. Identifying loci acted upon by evolution may further pinpoint variants critically involved in disease etiology, and designing studies to capture these effects will enrich our understanding of the genetic contributions to immunity and immune dysregulation.","tags":["environment; genetics; human immune response variation; natural selection; quantitative trait loci;My Publications"],"title":"Shaping immunity: The influence of natural selection on population immune diversity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katherine A Aracena","Yen-Lung Lin","Kaixuan Luo","Alain Pacis","Saideep Gona","Zepeng Mu","Vania Yotova","Renata Sindeaux","Albena Pramatarova","Marie-Michelle Simon","Xun Chen","Cristian Groza","David Lougheed","Romain Gregoire","David Brownlee","Carly Boye","Roger Pique-Regi","Yang Li","Xin He","David Bujold","Tomi Pastinen","Guillaume Bourque","Luis B Barreiro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1706745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1709509939,"objectID":"6820b1454fa0a09e11af8f9f2112e286","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/aracena-2024/","publishdate":"2024-03-03T23:52:18.872513Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aracena-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Humans display remarkable interindividual variation in their immune response to identical challenges. Yet, our understanding of the genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to such variation remains limited. Here we performed in-depth genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional profiling on primary macrophages derived from individuals of European and African ancestry before and after infection with influenza A virus. We show that baseline epigenetic profiles are strongly predictive of the transcriptional response to influenza A virus across individuals. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping revealed highly coordinated genetic effects on gene regulation, with many cis-acting genetic variants impacting concomitantly  gene expression and multiple epigenetic marks. These data reveal that ancestry-associated differences in the epigenetic landscape can be genetically controlled, even more than gene expression. Lastly, among QTL variants that colocalized with immune-disease loci, only 7% were gene  expression QTL, while the remaining genetic variants impact epigenetic marks, stressing the importance of considering molecular phenotypes beyond gene expression in disease-focused studies.","tags":[],"title":"Epigenetic variation impacts individual differences in the transcriptional response to influenza infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zepeng Mu","Wei Wei","Benjamin Jung Fair","Jinlin Miao","Ping Zhu","Yang I Li"],"categories":[],"content":" ","date":1619654400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600973615,"objectID":"498c58439e585afbb4f2297c6b740441","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/mu-2020-impact/","publishdate":"2020-09-24T18:53:32.261929Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mu-2020-impact/","section":"publication","summary":"**Background**: The vast majority of trait-associated variants identified using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are noncoding, and therefore assumed to impact gene regulation. However, the majority of trait-associated loci are unexplained by regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTLs).\n\n**Results**: We perform a comprehensive characterization of the putative mechanisms by which GWAS loci impact human immune traits. By harmonizing four major immune QTL studies, we identify 26,271 expression QTLs (eQTLs) and 23,121 splicing QTLs (sQTLs) spanning 18 immune cell types. Our colocalization analyses between QTLs and trait-associated loci from 72 GWAS reveals that genetic effects on RNA expression and splicing in immune cells colocalize with 40.4% of GWAS loci for immune-related traits, in many cases increasing the fraction of colocalized loci by two fold compared to previous studies. Notably, we find that the largest contributors of this increase are splicing QTLs, which colocalize on average with 14% of all GWAS loci that do not colocalize with eQTLs. By contrast, we find that cell type-specific eQTLs, and eQTLs with small effect sizes contribute very few new colocalizations. To investigate the 60% of GWAS loci that remain unexplained, we collect H3K27ac CUT\u0026Tag data from rheumatoid arthritis and healthy controls, and find large-scale differences between immune cells from the different disease contexts, including at regions overlapping unexplained GWAS loci.\n\n**Conclusion**: Altogether, our work supports RNA splicing as an important mediator of genetic effects on immune traits, and suggests that we must expand our study of regulatory processes in disease contexts to improve functional interpretation of as yet unexplained GWAS loci.

However, data produced by scRNA-seq often exhibit batch effects that can be specific to a cell-type, to a sample, or to an experiment, which prevent integration or comparisons across multiple experiments. Here, we present Dmatch, a method that leverages an external expression atlas of human primary cells and kernel density matching to align multiple scRNA-seq experiments for downstream biological analysis. Dmatch facilitates alignment of scRNA-seq datasets with cell-types that may overlap only partially, and thus allows integration of multiple distinct scRNA-seq experiments to extract biological insights. In simulation, Dmatch compares favorably to other alignment methods, both in terms of reducing sample-specific clustering, and in terms of avoiding over-correction. When applied to scRNA-seq data collected from clinical samples in a healthy individual and five autoimmune disease patients, Dmatch enabled cell-type-specific differential gene expression comparisons across biopsy sites and disease conditions, and uncovered a shared population of pro-inflammatory monocytes across biopsy sites in RA patients. We further show that Dmatch increases the number of eQTLs mapped from population scRNA-seq data. Dmatch is fast, scalable, and improves the utility of scRNA-seq for several important applications.

To begin addressing this gap, we used 3’ Seq to study the impact of genetic variation on alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the nuclear and total mRNA fractions of 52 HapMap Yoruba human lymphoblastoid cell lines. We mapped 602 APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 152 were nuclear specific. Effect sizes at intronic apaQTLs are negatively correlated with eQTL effect sizes. These observations suggest genetic variants can decrease mRNA expression levels by increasing usage of intronic PAS. We also identified 24 apaQTLs associated with protein levels, but not mRNA expression. Finally, we found that 19% of apaQTLs can be associated with disease. Thus, our work demonstrates that APA links genetic variation to variation in gene expression, protein expression, and disease risk, and reveals uncharted modes of genetic regulation.","tags":null,"title":"Alternative polyadenylation mediates genetic regulation of gene expression","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" In this blog post, I use ggplot() to plot a legend for chromHMM annotation.\nchromHMM uses a Hidden Markov Model to integrate a range of epigenetic markers and predicts the chromatin states, like Transcription Start Sites or enhancers.\nThe table I use here comes from website: ROADMAP epigenetics project web portal.

Here we describe the design and implementation of an engineered Escherichia coli capable of degrading tetracycline (Tc)-one of the commonly used antibiotics once on humans and now on poultry, cattle and fisheries. A Tc-degrading enzyme, TetX, from the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis was cloned and recombinantly expressed in E. coli and fully characterized, including its Km and kcat value. We quantitatively evaluated its activity both in vitro and in vivo by UV–Vis spectrometer and LC-MS. Moreover, we used a tetracycline inducible amplification circuit including T7 RNA polymerase and its specific promoter PT7 to enhance the expression level of TetX, and studied the dose-response of TetX under different inducer concentrations. Since the deployment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside laboratory brings about safety concerns, it is necessary to explore the possibility of integrating a kill-switch. Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) systems were used to construct a mutually dependent host-plasmid platform and biocontainment systems in various academic and industrious situations. We selected nine TA systems from various bacteria strains and measured the toxicity of toxins (T) and the detoxifying activity of cognate antitoxins (A) to validate their potential to be used to build a kill-switch. These results prove the possibility of using engineered microorganisms to tackle antibiotic residues in environment efficiently and safely.","tags":null,"title":"A genetically engineered Escherichia coli that senses and degrades tetracycline antibiotic residue","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"542b906bc0450bd85477faa72e9ff4b5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/myblog/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/myblog/","section":"","summary":"CV","tags":null,"title":"Curriculum Vitae","type":"widget_page"}]
