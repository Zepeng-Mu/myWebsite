However, for many complex traits, multiple cell-types are involved. This applies particularly to immune-related traits, for which many immune cell-types and contexts play a role. Here, we studied the impact of immune gene regulatory variants on complex traits to better understand genetic risk mediated through immune cell-types. We identified 26,271 expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 23,121 splicing QTLs in 18 immune cell-types, and analyzed their overlap with trait-associated loci from 72 genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We showed that effects on RNA expression and splicing in immune cells colocalize with an average of 40.4% and 27.7% GWAS loci for immune-related and non-immune traits, respectively. Notably, we found that a large number of loci (mean: 14%) colocalize with splicing QTLs but not expression QTLs. The 60% GWAS loci without colocalization harbor genes that have lower expression levels, are less tolerant to loss-of-function mutations, and more enhancerrich than genes at colocalized loci. To further investigate the 60% GWAS loci not explained by our regulatory QTLs, we collected H3K27ac CUT\u0026Tag data from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. We found several unexplained GWAS hits lying within regions with higher H3K27ac activity in RA patients. We also observed that enrichment of RA GWAS heritability is greater in H3K27ac regions in immune cell-types from RA patients compared to healthy controls. Our study paves the way for future QTL studies to elucidate the mechanisms of as yet unexplained GWAS loci.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of cell-type and context-dependent regulatory variants on human immune traits","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Briana E Mittleman","Sebastian Pott","Shane Warland","Tony Zeng","Zepeng Mu","Mayher Kaur","Yoav Gilad","Yang I Li"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1593043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593043200,"objectID":"a4e1d37ae119c96a16f38988d14f6e95","permalink":"https://zepengmu.netlify.app/publication/apaqtl/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/apaqtl/","section":"publication","summary":"Little is known about co-transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms linking noncoding variation to variation in organismal traits. To begin addressing this gap, we used 3’ Seq to study the impact of genetic variation on alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the nuclear and total mRNA fractions of 52 HapMap Yoruba human lymphoblastoid cell lines. We mapped 602 APA quantitative trait loci (apaQTLs) at 10% FDR, of which 152 were nuclear specific. Effect sizes at intronic apaQTLs are negatively correlated with eQTL effect sizes. These observations suggest genetic variants can decrease mRNA expression levels by increasing usage of intronic PAS. We also identified 24 apaQTLs associated with protein levels, but not mRNA expression. Finally, we found that 19% of apaQTLs can be associated with disease. Thus, our work demonstrates that APA links genetic variation to variation in gene expression, protein expression, and disease risk, and reveals uncharted modes of genetic regulation.","tags":null,"title":"Alternative polyadenylation mediates genetic regulation of gene expression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengjie Chen","Qi Zhan","Zepeng Mu","Lili Wang","Zhaohui Zheng","Jinlin Miao","Ping Zhu","Yang I Li"],"categories":[],"content":"  ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600268369,"objectID":"85e22065018dc4392c8d5c3ccae0358f","permalink":"https://zepengmu.netlify.app/publication/chen-2020-alignment/","publishdate":"2020-09-16T14:59:27.574858Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-2020-alignment/","section":"publication","summary":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is poised to replace bulk cell RNA sequencing for most biological and medical applications as it allows users to measure gene expression levels in a cell-type-specific manner. However, data produced by scRNA-seq often exhibit batch effects that can be specific to a cell-type, to a sample, or to an experiment, which prevent integration or comparisons across multiple experiments. Here, we present Dmatch, a method that leverages an external expression atlas of human primary cells and kernel density matching to align multiple scRNA-seq experiments for downstream biological analysis. Dmatch facilitates alignment of scRNA-seq datasets with cell-types that may overlap only partially, and thus allows integration of multiple distinct scRNA-seq experiments to extract biological insights. In simulation, Dmatch compares favorably to other alignment methods, both in terms of reducing sample-specific clustering, and in terms of avoiding over-correction. When applied to scRNA-seq data collected from clinical samples in a healthy individual and five autoimmune disease patients, Dmatch enabled cell-type-specific differential gene expression comparisons across biopsy sites and disease conditions, and uncovered a shared population of pro-inflammatory monocytes across biopsy sites in RA patients. We further show that Dmatch increases the number of eQTLs mapped from population scRNA-seq data. Dmatch is fast, scalable, and improves the utility of scRNA-seq for several important applications. Dmatch is freely available online (https://qzhan321.github.io/dmatch/).","tags":[],"title":"Alignment of single-cell RNA-seq samples without over-correction using kernel density matching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haley E Randolph","Zepeng Mu","Jessica K Fiege","Beth K Thielen","Jean-Christophe Grenier","Mari S Cobb","Julie G Hussin","Yang I Li","Ryan A Langlois","Luis B Barreiro"],"categories":[],"content":"  ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608672559,"objectID":"b00f46b7edae75fddf534f3b7f2bc5e3","permalink":"https://zepengmu.netlify.app/publication/randolph-2020-12-21-423830/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T21:29:19.18149Z","relpermalink":"/publication/randolph-2020-12-21-423830/","section":"publication","summary":"Humans vary in their susceptibility to infectious disease, partly due to variation in the immune response following infection. Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to quantify genetic contributions to this variation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, focusing specifically on the transcriptional response to influenza infection. We find that monocytes are the most responsive to influenza infection, but that all cell types mount a conserved interferon response, which is stronger in individuals with increased European ancestry. By comparing European American and African American individuals, we show that genetic ancestry effects on expression are common, influencing 29% of genes, but highly cell type specific. Further, we demonstrate that much of this population-associated expression variation is explained by cis expression quantitative trait loci, which are enriched for signatures of recent positive selection. Our findings establish common cis-regulatory variants -- including those that are differentiated by genetic ancestry -- as important determinants of the antiviral immune response.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.","tags":[],"title":"Single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals pervasive but highly cell type-specific genetic ancestry effects on the response to viral infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553817600,"objectID":"f1e067ee83f0a3ccf22fe3cd0a562336","permalink":"https://zepengmu.netlify.app/mypublication/","publishdate":"2019-03-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/mypublication/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Publications","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" In this blog post, I use ggplot() to plot a legend for chromHMM annotation.\nchromHMM uses a Hidden Markov Model to integrate a range of epigenetic markers and predicts the chromatin states, like Transcription Start Sites or enhancers.\nThe table I use here comes from website: ROADMAP epigenetics project web portal.

We report the largest investigation of serum platinum levels to date of 1,010 testicular cancer survivors (TCS) assessed 1–35 years after CBC and evaluate genetic contributions to these levels.\n\n**Experimental Design**: Eligible TCS given 300 or 400 (±15) mg/m2 cisplatin underwent extensive audiometric testing, clinical examination, completed questionnaires, and had crude serum platinum levels measured.

We observed a significant, positive association between residual platinum values and luteinizing hormone (age-adjusted P = 6.58 × 10−3).

Here we describe the design and implementation of an engineered Escherichia coli capable of degrading tetracycline (Tc)-one of the commonly used antibiotics once on humans and now on poultry, cattle and fisheries. A Tc-degrading enzyme, TetX, from the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis was cloned and recombinantly expressed in E. coli and fully characterized, including its Km and kcat value. We quantitatively evaluated its activity both in vitro and in vivo by UV–Vis spectrometer and LC-MS. Moreover, we used a tetracycline inducible amplification circuit including T7 RNA polymerase and its specific promoter PT7 to enhance the expression level of TetX, and studied the dose-response of TetX under different inducer concentrations. Since the deployment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) outside laboratory brings about safety concerns, it is necessary to explore the possibility of integrating a kill-switch. Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) systems were used to construct a mutually dependent host-plasmid platform and biocontainment systems in various academic and industrious situations. We selected nine TA systems from various bacteria strains and measured the toxicity of toxins (T) and the detoxifying activity of cognate antitoxins (A) to validate their potential to be used to build a kill-switch. These results prove the possibility of using engineered microorganisms to tackle antibiotic residues in environment efficiently and safely.","tags":null,"title":"A genetically engineered Escherichia coli that senses and degrades tetracycline antibiotic residue","type":"publication"}]
