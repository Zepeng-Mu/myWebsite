 abstract = {Humans exhibit considerable variability in their immune responses
to the same immune challenges. Such variation is widespread and affects
individual and population-level susceptibility to infectious diseases and
immune disorders. Although the factors influencing immune response diversity
are partially understood, what mechanisms lead to the wide range of immune
traits in healthy individuals remain largely unexplained. Here, we discuss the
role that natural selection has played in driving phenotypic differences in
immune responses across populations and present-day susceptibility to
immune-related disorders. Further, we touch on future directions in the field
of immunogenomics, highlighting the value of expanding this work to human
populations globally, the utility of modeling the immune response as a dynamic
process, and the importance of considering the potential polygenic nature of
natural selection. Identifying loci acted upon by evolution may further
pinpoint variants critically involved in disease etiology, and designing
studies to capture these effects will enrich our understanding of the genetic
contributions to immunity and immune dysregulation.},
