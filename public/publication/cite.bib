  abstract     = {Genetic studies have identified thousands of individual
                  disease-associated non-coding alleles, but the identification of the causal
                  alleles and their functions remains a critical bottleneck1. CRISPR–Cas editing
                  has enabled targeted modification of DNA to introduce and test disease
                  alleles. However, the combination of inefficient editing, heterogeneous
                  editing outcomes in individual cells and nonspecific transcriptional changes
                  caused by editing and culturing conditions limits the ability to detect the
                  functional consequences of disease alleles2,3. To overcome these challenges,
                  we present a multi-omic single-cell sequencing approach that directly
                  identifies genomic DNA edits, assays the transcriptome and measures
                  cell-surface protein expression. We apply this approach to investigate the
                  effects of gene disruption, deletions in regulatory regions, non-coding
                  single-nucleotide polymorphism alleles and multiplexed editing. We identify
                  the effects of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms, including the
                  state-specific effects of an IL2RA autoimmune variant in primary human T
                  cells. Multimodal functional genomic single-cell assays, including DNA
                  sequencing, enable the identification of causal variation in primary human
                  cells and bridge a crucial gap in our understanding of complex human diseases.
                  A plate-based assay called CRAFTseq has been developed that uses ‘multi-omic’
                  single-cell RNA sequencing and direct genotyping of CRISPR edits to test the
                  functional effects of genetic variants on cell state and function.},
